I just read a [blog post][blogging] which described the best way to start blogging and how to become successful as a blogger. Now My goal is certainly not to become succesful as a blogger, I am not really interested in becoming famous or having many people read my writing. That all sounds too much anxiety-inducing. However I am very interested in the creative element of blogging, I feel like I often do not express myself enough even though I know that writing about interesting topics can be very satisfying. My plan then is to set up a schedule where I will upload two post to this blog every week. The aim will be to stick to this schedule even if I feel like I have nothing to write about. Because that sounds like the only way to really make sure that I do write about the interesting ideas and don't let them wither away without putting them on paper.

To help myself out I will keep a short list of the things I plan to write about:
 - Paper reviews & summaries
 - Motivation
 - productivity
 - Quantified Self & time tracking
 - coding problems
 - emacs tips, tricks and workflows
 - org-mode configurations and workflows
 - Thesis writing tricks & strategies
 - Lattice QCD theory
 - Philosophy of Science
 - General physics concepts
 - Cycling strategy, stories, race reviews and discussions
 - Book reviews

Here I will also post some links to sites that give good tips & tricks on writing blogs:
 - [Hints for revising][revising]
 - [Writing tips for non-writers who don't want to work at writing][writing]
 - Stephen King - On Writing
 - [Writing is thinking: Learn to write with confidence][thinking]
