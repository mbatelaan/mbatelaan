I think Australia was one of the last places where Dune was released, I watched it in early December. Having read the book approximately one year earlier I was very keen to see the film in cinemas. I have to admit that I had forgotten parts of the plot of the book before going in, but I decided to not do a refresh before watching it. The visuals and the soundtrack are both exceptional, which is to be expected from Denis Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer.

I Really enjoyed the balance they found between using exposition and explicit explanations. Many things were left unsaid but this only added to the mistery of the world and made it more intrigueing. The performance by Timothee Chalamet and the rest of the cast was very engaging, especially Javier Bardem who fit his role perfectly.

Overall the movie was thoroughly enjoyable and I cannot wait for the second part to be released. Seeing it has made me go out and find a copy of Dune Messiah to immerse myself further into the Dune universe.
