Druk is a Danish film by director Thomas Vinterberg starring Mads Mikkelsen. The film starts with a quote from SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard:
>What is youth?  
>A dream.  
>What is Love?  
>The dream's content.  

The film tells the story of four high school teachers who decide to embark on an experiment in which they explore the full spectrum of alcohol use. The main character, Martin is a history teacher who has trouble with his class of seniors who complain that they do not trust him to adequately prepare them for the final exams that year. His teaching style is very erratic and he shows no enthusiasm for the content at all. After a birthday dinner with the other three theachers where Martin vents his worries and anxieties about the state of his life, the group of four decide to embark on an experiment. The motivation for the experiment comes from an idea by a philosopher that humans are born with a blood alcohol content that is 0.05 too low.

The idea of the experiment is that they will drink throughout the work day to keep their BAC at 0.05, but at the same time they will restrict their drinking to only working hours. The aim is to extract the useful effects of alcohol in terms of its reduction of social inhibitions and the reduced anxiety.
 - They all start out very excited with the experiment
  - I wonder how much of it is the excitement of starting something new
 - They quickly realize how much better their lives are when they are slightly intoxicated.
 - Martin chases an even higher high
 - He inevitably crashes down
