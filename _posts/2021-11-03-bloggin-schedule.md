I just read a [blog post][blogging] which described the best way to start blogging and how to become successful as a blogger. Now My goal is certainly not to become succesful as a blogger, I am not really interested in becoming famous or having many people read my writing. That all sounds too much anxiety-inducing. However I am very interested in the creative element of blogging, I feel like I often do not express myself enough even though I know that writing about interesting topics can be very satisfying. My plan then is to set up a schedule where I will upload one post to this blog every week. The aim will be to stick to this schedule even if I feel like I have nothing to write about. Because that sounds like the only way to really make sure that I do write about the interesting ideas and don't let them wither away without putting them on paper.
