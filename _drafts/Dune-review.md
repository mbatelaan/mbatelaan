I think Australia was one of the last places where Dune was released, I watched it in early December. Having read the book approximately one year earlier I was very keen to see the film in cinemas. I have to admit that I had forgotten parts of the plot of the book before going in, but I decided to not do a refresh before watching it. The visuals and the soundtrack are both exceptional, which is to be expected from Denis Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer.
