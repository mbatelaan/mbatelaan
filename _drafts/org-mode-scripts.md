I have been using emacs org-mode to track my work time for a while now. I also use it to keep track of all my todos and ideas. The main way I use the clocking feature of org mode is together with [org-pomodoro][org-pomodoro].

To make sure that I can actively see the clock outside emacs I also have a bash script which I can run in my DE panel to show the current task and the clocked time.
