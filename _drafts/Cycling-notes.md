The criteriums organised by the Norwood Cycling Club in Victoria Park have a very unique feel to them which makes the strategies interesting to consider. The track (short course) is special in that it was designed as part of the old Formula one track. This means that it is very wide and the corners are very wide for cycling standards. However the last corner can be somewhat technical as at high speeds it is too sharp to pedal through and there is a slight rise coming out of it. This rise then leads in to a chicane which ends 100m before the finish line.

Sprinting through the roundabouts  
Only fifteen minutes till the start  
the sun peaking through the clouds  
I can already feel the beating of my heart  

Chewing a banana while I tighten the transponder  
I take a look around looking for a red number  
'Will today be my day?' I wonder  
Two quick laps to get the legs limber  

Lining up in front of the grandstand  
one last check of my shoe straps  
The handlebars feeling comfortable in my hand  
The sun finds more and more gaps  

To the sound of fourty clicks and beeps  
The bunch starts to roll from the line  
Shuffling for position has already begun  
Trying to make the best position mine
