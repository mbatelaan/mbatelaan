I have been interested in so-called quantified self tricks and  methods for a while now. My interest in these stems from my inability to will myself to focus which I have struggled with for a long time now. Over time I have used tried out many strategies to quantify and track how I spend my time using various technologies. It has gotten to a point where I think it is worth writing about the things I have tried and how they have helped me and how I have attempted to tailor them to my needs. It is not only time tracking that I have used, health tracking and tracking stats about my computers have also kept me busy over the years. I will take some time to discuss these here with the aim to reflect on them for my own benefit as well as anyone else interested in the quantified self movement.
