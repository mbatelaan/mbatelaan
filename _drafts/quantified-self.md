I have been interested in so-called quantified self tricks and  methods for a while now. My interest in these stems from my inability to will myself to focus which I have struggled with for a long time now. Over time I have used tried out many strategies to quantify and track how I spend my time using various technologies. It has gotten to a point where I think it is worth writing about the things I have tried and how they have helped me and how I have attempted to tailor them to my needs. It is not only time tracking that I have used, health tracking and tracking stats about my computers have also kept me busy over the years. I will take some time to discuss these here with the aim to reflect on them for my own benefit as well as anyone else interested in the quantified self movement.

Time Tracking
=============

The way I see it there are two main methods of time tracking, they are passive and active tracking. Passive tracking is the easier method but it is less useful in many ways. Being passive, it relies on technology to do the tracking for you, this means using some program that will track which window is open, how many keystrokes are made, the number of git commits, words written or many other metrics. This also includes most time trackers on mobile devices which will count screen-time, number of unlocks or apps used. I have found these methods of tracking time mainly useful for the purpose of recording negative time use. By this I mean time that is spent doing things I would rather not do, such as browsing social media, reading emails or generally wasting time with procrastination. In this sense they are very useful for finding time that is not spent productively, they are less useful for classifying time as being spent productively.

To classify time as being spent productively I have found active time trackers as being more useful.
