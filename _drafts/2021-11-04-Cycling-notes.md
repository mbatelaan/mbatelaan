The criteriums organised by the Norwood Cycling Club in Victoria Park have a very unique feel to them which makes the strategies interesting to consider. The track (short course) is special in that it was designed as part of the old Formula one track. This means that it is very wide and the corners are very wide for cycling standards. However the last corner can be somewhat technical as at high speeds it is too sharp to pedal through and there is a slight rise coming out of it. This rise then leads in to a chicane which ends 100m before the finish line.
